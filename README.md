# D-3-Challenge
 Using the D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I coded the graphic's in the `app.js` file of my directory. I pulled in data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. My scatter plotm will appear like an image at the top of the section.
